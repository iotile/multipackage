# List of all component packages in this repository
#
# This is the master list that is used to determine which subfolders of
# this repository contain python packages that should be tested and released.
#
# There should be one component listed on each line in the following format:
# package_name: relative_path[, compatibility=(universal|python2|python3)]
#
# Whitespace is ignored.  The package name cannot contain a - character or
# other special characters.  The relative path should be the path to the
# folder containing the setup.py file for the package.
# 
# If the package is not compatible with either python 2 or python 3, you
# can pass a compatibility flag, specifying which version of python it 
# is compatible with.  The default is a universal package that is compatible
# with both python 2 and python 3.
