# `multipackage` Release Notes

## v0.1.0 (11/29/2018)

- Update location of multipackage files to all live under a `.multipackage`
  directory.  This consolidates everything into a single place and avoids
  cluttering up the repository.  It makes `multipackage` more like `git` in that
  it has a folder that it manages for you and a cli tool that interacts with
  that folder.

## 0.0.1 (11/29/2018)

- Initial commit
